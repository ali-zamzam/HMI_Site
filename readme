The purpose of this project:

- Use AI solutions to be able to optimize the implementation of electro mobility in France according to public transport use.
- Measure whether more Micro-Electro mobility is needed to make it available in one place to another.
- Create an HMI to access prediction results.


What has been done to create the predictive model:
- Identify needs and issues.
- Identify the data necessary the treatment of the project.
- Create algorithms, prepare data, Data transformation, Data cleaning.
- Data Exploitation for the creation of predictive models.
- Train and test the Machine learning model.
